<p>
Line 418 of emboss/embossversion.c is simply printing the value of _FORTIFY_SOURCE which may have some strange definition on your system.
</p>

<p>
Try replacing line 418 with:
</p>
<pre class="code">      ajFmtPrintF(outfile, &quot;_FORTIFY_SOURCE defined\n&quot;);</pre>

<p>
and it should be fine …
