For the benefit of anyone else arriving here by Google, note comment 19, by Steven, in that bug report.

It's easy to overlook this fix, amongst all the other reports and the mess of copy-pasted logfiles and stuff.

I don't seem to be able to link directly to the comment, so here's the relevant part:

Quote:	
if i disable the threading option (threaded(yes) => threaded(no)) in /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf the issue is gone

Code:	
options {
        threaded(no);
        chain_hostnames(no);
        stats_freq(43200);
};


One reboot later, this seems to be working for me.

I hope this helps others.
