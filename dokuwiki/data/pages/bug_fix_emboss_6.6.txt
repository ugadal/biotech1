Line 418 of emboss/embossversion.c is simply printing the value of _FORTIFY_SOURCE which may have some strange definition on your system.

Try replacing line 418 with:

        ajFmtPrintF(outfile, "_FORTIFY_SOURCE defined\n");

and it should be fine ...

A la ligne 417
<code> #ifdef FORTIFY_SOURCE </code>

On supprime l'underscore devant **FORTIFY**.
